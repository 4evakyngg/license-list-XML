        In the following, "the OCaml Core System" refers to all files marked
        "Copyright INRIA" in this distribution.

        The OCaml Core System is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 (included below).

        As a special exception to the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may
        link, statically or dynamically, a "work that uses the OCaml Core System"
        with a publicly distributed version of the OCaml Core System to produce
        an executable file containing portions of the OCaml Core System, and
        distribute that executable file under terms of your choice, without any
        of the additional requirements listed in clause 6 of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License. By "a publicly distributed version of the OCaml
        Core System", we mean either the unmodified OCaml Core System as
        distributed by INRIA, or a modified version of the OCaml Core System
        that is distributed under the conditions defined in clause 2 of the GNU
        Lesser General Public License. This exception does not however
        invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered
        by the GNU Lesser General Public License.
