          Purpose
          <p>
          This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the 
          software to which it applies (the “Work”), either as-is or in 
          modified form, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners 
          and contributors to the software from liability. 
          </p>
          <p>
          This License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of 
          third parties who receive the Work from you.  If any non-affiliated 
          third party receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from 
          You, this License requires that You provide that third party all the 
          permissions and materials needed to independently use and modify the 
          Work without that third party having a loss of data or capability due 
          to your actions. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.

          Receiving a License
          <p>
          In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The 
          rules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the 
          Licensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything 
          with the Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.

              Application
              <p>
              The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it 
              from Licensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or 
              implementations created by You that contain any licenseable 
              portion of the Work (a “Modified Work”). Unless specified, any 
              reference to the Work also applies to a Modified Work.

              Offer and Acceptance
              <p>
              This License is automatically offered to every person and 
              organization. You show that you accept this License and agree to 
              its conditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent 
              this License, would infringe any intellectual property right held 
              by Licensor.

              Compliance and Remedies
              <p>
              Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this 
              License places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the 
              License and infringes the intellectual property rights of the 
              Licensor. In the event of infringement, the terms and conditions 
              of this License may be enforced by Licensor under the 
              intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are 
              subject. You also agree that either the Licensor or a Recipient 
              (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may enforce the terms 
              and conditions of this License against You via specific 
              performance.

          Conditions
          <p>
          If You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the 
          Work, or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed, 
          communicated, made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate 
          third party (a “Recipient”), either via physical delivery or via a 
          network connection to the Recipient, You must comply with the following

              Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each 
              Recipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, 
              the Source Code corresponding to the Work. 
              </p>
              <p>
              The “Source Code” of the Work means the form of the Work preferred 
              for making modifications, including any comments, configuration 
              information, documentation, help materials, installation 
              instructions, cryptographic seeds or keys, and any information 
              reasonably necessary for the Recipient to independently compile and 
              use the Source Code and to have full access to the functionality 
              contained in the Work.

                  corresponding to those portions of the Work remaining in the 
                  Modified Work as well as the modifications used by You to 
                  create the Modified Work. The Source Code corresponding to the 
                  modifications in the Modified Work must be provided to the 
                  Recipient either a) under this License, or b) under a

              ownership interest, an existing right to possess, or where the data 
              has been generated by, for, or has been assigned to the Recipient.

              provide Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit 
              Recipient’s ability to independently work with their User Data, any 
              other Software in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a 
              whole may be licensed under the terms of your choice.

          until all Licensor’s intellectual property rights in the Software 
          expire, whichever comes first (“Term”). This License cannot be revoked, 
          only terminated for the reasons listed below.

              Effect of Termination
              <p>
              If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions 
              granted to You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically 
              terminate. You will immediately cease exercising any permissions 
              granted in this License relative to the Work, including as part of 
              any Modified Work.

              Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement
              <p>
              This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with 
              any of the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to 
              termination for non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under 
              this License will automatically be reinstated if You come into 
              compliance with all the conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) 
              days of being notified by Licensor or an intended third party 
              beneficiary of Your noncompliance. You are eligible for 
              reinstatement of permissions for the Work one time only, and only 
              for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of 
              noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the Work under this 
              License due to either a) sustained noncompliance lasting more than 
              sixty days or b) subsequent termination for noncompliance after 
              reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are specifically 
              restored by Licensor in writing.

              Termination Due to Litigation
              <p>
              If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of 
              the Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work 
              directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions 
              granted to You by this License shall terminate. In the event of 
              termination due to litigation, all permissions validly granted by 
              You under this License, directly or indirectly, shall survive 
              termination. Administrative review procedures, declaratory judgment 
              actions, counterclaims in response to patent litigation, and 
              enforcement actions against former Licensees terminated under this 
              section do not cause termination due to litigation.

              Affiliates
              <p>
              An “Affiliate” means any other entity that, directly or indirectly 
              through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or 
              is under common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee 
              and natural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing 
              services to Licensee are also Affiliates.

              Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law
              <p>
              A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee 
              relating to a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be 
              brought only in the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under 
              the laws of a particular jurisdiction (excluding its 
              conflict-of-law provisions), if Licensor provides conspicuous 
              notice of the particular jurisdiction to all Licensees.

              No Sublicensing
              <p>
              This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work 
              or a Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically 
              receives a license under the terms described in this License. You 
              may not impose any further reservations, conditions, or other 
              provisions on any Recipients’ exercise of the permissions granted 
              herein.

              Attorneys' Fees

              In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking 
              damages relating thereto, including by an intended third party 
              beneficiary, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its 
              costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable 
              attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, 
              including any appeal of such action. A “prevailing party” is the 
              party that achieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, 
              including through settlement. This section shall survive the 
              termination of this License.

              No Waiver
              <p>
              Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License 
              will not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision 
              nor limit Licensor’s ability to enforce such provision at a later 
              time.

              Severability
              <p>
              If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such 
              provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it 
              enforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be 
              interpreted to the effect and intent of the original portion. If 
              such a construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable 
              portion will be severed from this License but the rest of this 
              License will remain in full force and effect.
