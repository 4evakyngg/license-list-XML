             However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and

             additional conditions must be clearly described in the
             notice provisions required under Section 3.4.  Any
             alteration of the terms of this License will apply to
             all copies of the Covered Software distributed by You
             or by any downstream recipients that receive the

                 or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone
                 who distributes Covered Software as permitted

                 including, without limitation, damages for
                 lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
                 computer failure or malfunction, or any and
                 all other commercial damages or losses, even
                 if such party shall have been informed of the
                 possibility of such damages. This limitation
                 of liability shall not apply to liability for
