## License Inclusion Principles

### Background Principles 
The Software Package Data Exchange® (SPDX®) specification is a standard format for communicating, among other things, the components, licenses, and copyrights associated with open source software packages. Use of this standard streamlines license identification across the supply chain while reducing redundant work.

The goal of SPDX is not to evaluate licensing information or to provide legal interpretations. The only goal is to reliably and consistently communicate and share objective factual information so that organizations using software components will have the information necessary to conduct their independent analysis and evaluation. Establishing a consistent, reliable, and reusable way to communicate license information for software components will facilitate open source license compliance along the supply chain.

Although SPDX has traditionally focused on open source licensing, software may contain a mix of open-source licensed, commercially-licensed, freeware licensed, and other varieties of licensed software. Thus, it is feasible that a future version of the standard may develop a standardized method of identifying non-open source licenses contained within software packages.

Because the present focus of SPDX is the collection and presentation of the open-source software licenses contained in a software package, any license that is a candidate for inclusion on the SPDX License List must have the general attributes of an "open source" license.

### Open Source Definition 

The terms "free software," "open source software," or their variants (FOSS, FLOSS, libre software, etc.) are defined differently by different organizations. At a minimum, all definitions of open source or free software include the characteristic that the source code be made available for inspection and modification and that the source code may be freely distributed. However, there are a number of other characteristics that vary depending on the policy focus of the defining organization. Even though the various definitions of open source software differ in some respects, there are certain fundamental characteristics commonly incorporated in all these definitions.

The SPDX Legal Team uses the definition promulgated by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) as the basis for analyzing candidate licenses for inclusion on the SPDX License List. That definition is available at https://opensource.org/osd.

### Candidate License Analysis

Determining whether a candidate license is deemed to be open source for purpose of inclusion on the SPDX License List requires the SPDX Legal Team to engage in a case-by-case evaluation of each candidate license. Candidate licenses that substantially comply with the open source definition will be added to the SPDX License List. Nevertheless, the SPDX Legal Team does not require (1) strict compliance with all elements of the OSI Definition; or (2) strict compliance with any particular element of the OSI Definition. Rather, it treats each element of the definition as a factor to be balanced in light of the totality of the candidate license and SPDX's goals and objectives. The SPDX Legal Team may also analyze “environmental” factors outside the open source definition, such as whether a candidate license is already included on the OSI license list or other such lists, whether the candidate license is in common use, or whether a commonly used open source project uses it (particularly where such open source project is a dependency on which other projects rely).

The SPDX Legal Team endeavors to explain its reasoning, analysis, and conclusions with respect to a candidate license as a means of developing precedent.
