* [License inclusion principles](DOCS/license-inclusion-principles.md) 
* 
* [Explanation of the fields contained on the list](DOCS/license-fields.md)
* 
* [SPDX License List Matching Guidelines](https://spdx.org/spdx-license-list/matching-guidelines) provides guidelines to be used for the purposes of matching licenses and license exceptions against those included on the SPDX License List.
* 
* [SPDX Specification](https://spdx.org/specifications): It is helpful to be familiar with certain sections of the SPDX Specification thatuse or deal with the SPDX License List. In particular: sub-sections related to license information in Section 3, 4, and 6; Appendices II, IV, and V.
